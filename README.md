Q. 1 What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list = my_list[-1:-4:-1]
print(my_list)
```

Which of the following options is correct?

- a) [5, 4, 3]
- b) [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
- c) [4, 3, 2]
- d) [3, 4, 5]

<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

The correct answer is: a) [5, 4, 3]

Explanation:

The code creates a list my_list with values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The slicing operation my_list[-1:-4:-1] extracts elements starting from the last element (-1) to the third element from the end (-4) in reverse order (-1 step).
Therefore, the result is [5, 4, 3].

The correct answer is: a) True

Explanation:

The code creates a list my_list with values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The slicing operation my_list[-1:-4:-1] extracts elements starting from the last element (-1) to the third element from the end (-4) in reverse order (-1 step).
Therefore, the result is [5, 4, 3].

Q. 3 What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
my_str = "Python"
result = my_str[6:] + my_str[:6]
print(result)
```

Which of the following options is correct?

- a) "Python"
- b) "PythonPython"
- c) "onPyth"
- d) Error
  
<details>

The correct answer is: a) "Python"

Explanation:

Slicing is forgiving in Python. When the indices exceed the length of the string, it wraps around.

Q. 4 What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
def func(a, b=[]):
    b.append(a)
    return b

print(func(1))
print(func(2))
```

Which of the following options is correct?

- a) [1], [2]
- b) [1], [1, 2]
- c) [1], [2]
- d) Error
  
<details>

The correct answer is: b) [1], [1, 2]

Explanation:

The default value for b is mutable (a list), and it is shared among all calls to the function.

Q. 5 What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
x = 10
y = 0
result = x/y if y != 0 else "Undefined"
print(result)
```

Which of the following options is correct?

- a) 0
- b) "Undefined"
- c) Error
- d) 1
  
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

The correct answer is: b) "Undefined"

Explanation:

The conditional expression checks if y is not equal to 0, and if true, it returns the result of x/y; otherwise, it returns "Undefined."
