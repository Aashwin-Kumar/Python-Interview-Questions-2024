Q. 1 What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list = my_list[-1:-4:-1]
print(my_list)
```

Which of the following options is correct?

- a) [5, 4, 3]
- b) [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
- c) [4, 3, 2]
- d) [3, 4, 5]

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

The correct answer is: a) [5, 4, 3]

Explanation:

The code creates a list my_list with values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The slicing operation my_list[-1:-4:-1] extracts elements starting from the last element (-1) to the third element from the end (-4) in reverse order (-1 step).
Therefore, the result is [5, 4, 3].

Q. 2 What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
x = 5
y = 5
print(x is y)
```

Which of the following options is correct?

- a) True
- b) False
- c) Depends on the Python version
- d) Error
  
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

The correct answer is: a) True

Explanation:

In CPython, small integers (usually -5 to 256) are cached and reused, so x is y will be True for small integers.

Q. 3 What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
my_str = "Python"
result = my_str[6:] + my_str[:6]
print(result)
```

Which of the following options is correct?

- a) "Python"
- b) "PythonPython"
- c) "onPyth"
- d) Error
  
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

The correct answer is: a) "Python"

Explanation:

Slicing is forgiving in Python. When the indices exceed the length of the string, it wraps around.

Q. 4 What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
def func(a, b=[]):
    b.append(a)
    return b

print(func(1))
print(func(2))
```

Which of the following options is correct?

- a) [1], [2]
- b) [1], [1, 2]
- c) [1], [2]
- d) Error
  
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

The correct answer is: b) [1], [1, 2]

Explanation:

The default value for b is mutable (a list), and it is shared among all calls to the function.

</details>

Q. 5 What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
x = 10
y = 0
result = x/y if y != 0 else "Undefined"
print(result)
```

Which of the following options is correct?

- a) 0
- b) "Undefined"
- c) Error
- d) 1
  
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

The correct answer is: b) "Undefined"

Explanation:

The conditional expression checks if y is not equal to 0, and if true, it returns the result of x/y; otherwise, it returns "Undefined."

Q. 8 What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
my_dict = {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
result = my_dict.get(4, 'four')
print(result)
```

Which of the following options is correct?

- a) 4
- b) 'four'
- c) 'three'
- d) Error
  
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

The correct answer is: b) 'four'

Explanation:

The get method returns the value for the specified key or a default value if the key is not present.

Q. 9 What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a.copy()
b[0] = 5
print(a)
```

Which of the following options is correct?

- a) [1, 2, 3]
- b) [5, 2, 3]
- c) [1, 5, 3]
- d) Error
  
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

The correct answer is: a) [1, 2, 3]

Explanation:

The copy method creates a new list, so modifying b does not affect a.

</details>

Q. 10 What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
def outer():
    x = 10
    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x += 5
    inner()
    return x

result = outer()
print(result)
```

Which of the following options is correct?

- a) 10
- b) 15
- c) Error
- d) 5
  
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

The correct answer is: b) 15

Explanation:

The nonlocal keyword allows the inner function to modify the variable in the outer scope.

Q. 11 What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
original_list = [1, [2, 3], 4]
shallow_copy = original_list.copy()

shallow_copy[0] = 5  
shallow_copy[1][0] = 'a' 

print(original_list)
```

Which of the following options is correct?

- a) [5, ['a', 3], 4]
- b) [5, [2, 3], 4]
- c) [1, ['a', 3], 4]
- d) [1, [2, 3], 4]
  
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

The correct answer is: c) [1, ['a', 3], 4]

Explanation:

modifications to the elements within nested objects (like shallow_copy[1][0]) impact both the original and the shallow copied lists, as they share references to the same nested objects.

</details>

Q. 12 What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy in Python?

  
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

Answer:

In Python, a shallow copy creates a new object but does not create copies of nested objects. It references the nested objects. 
On the other hand, a deep copy creates a new object and recursively creates copies of all nested objects, ensuring complete independence from the original object.

Q. 13 Explain the use of decorators in Python

  
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

Answer:

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods. 
They are defined using the @decorator syntax. Here's an example:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

Q. 14 What is the Global Keyword in Python?

  
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

Answer:

The global keyword in Python is used to indicate that a variable is a global variable, not a local one. 
When you want to modify a global variable within a function, you need to use the global keyword to declare it.

```python
x = 10

def modify_global():
    global x
    x += 5

modify_global()
print(x)  # Output: 15
```

Q. 15 What is lambda in Python? Why is it used?

  
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal the answer</summary>

Answer:

In Python, a lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. 
Lambda functions are also known as anonymous functions or lambda expressions. T
hey are used for creating small, one-time-use functions without the need for a full function definition using the def keyword.

The general syntax of a lambda function is:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```
Lambda functions can have any number of input parameters, but they can only have one expression. 
The result of the expression is implicitly returned from the lambda function.

Here's an example to illustrate the use of lambda functions:

```python
# Regular function definition
def square(x):
    return x**2

print(square(5))  # Output: 25

# Equivalent lambda function
square_lambda = lambda x: x**2

print(square_lambda(5))  # Output: 25
```
